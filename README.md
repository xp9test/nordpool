‚ö° Nordpool-Based Automations for Home Assistant
This repository contains three YAML-based solutions for Home Assistant that leverage Nordpool's 15-minute electricity pricing data to optimize device control and visualization.

üìÅ Contents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `nordpool_price_based_on_15min.yaml` | Automation blueprint that controls a device based on the cheapest hours of the day. You define how many hours per day the device should be active, and the automation selects the cheapest 15-minute intervals accordingly. |
| `nordpool_price_based_on_15min_range.yaml` | Similar to the first blueprint, but adds time window constraints. You can define `hour_min` and `hour_max` to restrict when the device is allowed to operate. |
| `nordpool_dashboard_cheapest.yaml` | ApexCharts-based dashboard card that visualizes today's energy prices. It highlights the cheapest 15-minute intervals with red markers, making it easy to track optimal usage times. |
